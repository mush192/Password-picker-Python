# Password-picker-Python
A password picker is an application that allows you to create strong passwords by combining words, numbers, and special characters.

A password prevents others from accessing our systemâ€™s e-mails and other login information. In this program, we are creating a password picker with Python to create safe and easy-to-remember passwords that will help your information to be kept private and secure.
A password picker will create a new password and show it to you every time you run your program which is the main logic behind creating a password picker with Python.Your program should keep creating a new password again and again until you find a strong and easy to remember.

A password picker randomly selects each of the four criteria i.e. adjective, name, number, special character and puts them together to create a strong password and display it on the screen. In the process, if you want another password, the program will repeat the steps, and if you no longer need a new password, the program will end.
